Your project goes here\! Before you submit, make sure your chunks are
turned off with `echo = FALSE`.

You can add sections as you see fit. Make sure you have a section called
Introduction at the beginning and a section called Conclusion at the
end. The rest is up to you\!

### Introduction

### Load Data and Libraries

### Suicides and Location

### Suicides and Economic Situation over all Time

Equation for the linear model is: (Suicides per 100k of the
population-hat) = (1.533301e+02) + (1.830459e-05\*GDP per capita($))
R-squared value is:
8.740802e-06

### Suicides and Year

Group number of suicides together by year to find number of suicides for
each year:

Create visualization to represent the number of suicides for each year:

### Suicides and Sex

Group number of suicides together by sex to find number of suicides for
each sex:

Create visualization to represent the number of suicides for each year:

Compare number of suicides for each sex per year:
